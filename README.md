# Info

This is a good example of the usefulness of the .env Python environment.

This project uses the pygame library, which, as of this writing, is only compatible with Python 3.13. Since I had 3.14 installed globally, I used the python launcher library `py` to install Python 3.13.9.

Then I ran the pygame installer against it:

`python3.13 -m pip install -U pygame`

In VS Code, I added a Python 3.13 environment (.env) into the project's folder, and installed the precompiled pygame library into it, using the same syntax as above.

Whenever you run the project, make sure the (.env) has loaded in the terminal environment.
